4 abstractions
    webhook (producer)
        receives webrequests from Github; forks handling of them
        writes to db

        abstract into Hackage library eventually

    ui
        serves webrequests
        queries db

    db
        stores a map: repo -> job queue

    consumer
        regularly polls db
        forks new jobs; executes them
        updates db when task is consumed
        talks to Travis

each of the 4 only interact with db; not each other

TODO:

    mock DB / network for testing?
