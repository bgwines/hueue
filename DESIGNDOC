4 abstractions
    webhook (producer)
        receives webrequests from Github; forks handling of them
        writes to db

        abstract into Hackage library eventually

    ui
        serves webrequests
        queries db

    db
        stores a map: repo -> job queue

    consumer
        regularly polls db
        forks new jobs; executes them
        updates db when task is consumed
        talks to Travis

each of the 4 only interact with db; not each other

TODO:
    testing
    docs
    mock DB / network for testing?
    handleGithubWebrequest types could be better?

    liftMonadTrans :: (MonadTrans t, Monad m, Monad m1) => (m a -> m1 a) -> t m a -> t m1 a
    liftMonadTrans liftMonad = lift . liftMonad . run
